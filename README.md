# Flight Booker

This project tries to represent an Airline Booker, where users can search desired dates and airports, then pick a flight and enter their personal and billing information.

In this project I practice advanced forms, dropdown menus, nested submissions and radio buttons. A project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-advanced-forms).
